*DESCRIPTION*:
In this project, I was supposed to perform API Integration and data visualization.
For API Integration, I used openweathermap and fetched API from it.
For data visualization, I imported matplotlib.py library in my python script.
By using various in built functions provided by matplotlib, I successfully plotted temperature vs date.
I also used datetime library to get date and time details.
